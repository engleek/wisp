GTalk is the official client for the Google Talk instant messaging network.
This software, while light and excellent, is lacking certain features, and is only available for Windows.

Wisp is an attempt at making a better client, inspired from simple IM programs, available for Window, MacOSX and Linux platforms, and as an added bonus, open source.
